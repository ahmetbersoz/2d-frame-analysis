# 2D Structural Frame Analyis

- This study presents a web-based structural analysis application developed for civil engineering researchers and students. 
The application is composed of two parts. 
- The first part pre-processor is that gathers information about structures such as location of nodal points, material properties, membersâ€™ connectivity etc. 
- The second part post-processor is the engine of the analysis which calculates support reactions and displacements and display these results to the users. 
- After the development of the pre-processor and post-processor, these two parts were attached to each other. PHP and HTML was utilized for the web page. MATBLAB is used for the maathematical calculations.
